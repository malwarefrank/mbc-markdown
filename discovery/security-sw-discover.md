Security Software Discovery
===========================
Malware may try to get a listing of security software or defensive tools installed on the system. Note that security software aims to *detect/mitigate* malware on a system whereas analysis tools (see [Analysis Tool Discovery](../discovery/analysis-tool-discover.md)) are used to *analyze* malware.

See ATT&CK: [**Security Software Discovery**](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1063).
