Software Packing
================
This code characteristic - Software Packing - can make static and behavioral analysis difficult and includes packing with software protectors, such as Themida and Armadillo [[1]](#1). Methods related to anti-analysis are below. 

This description refines the ATT&CK [**Software Packing**](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1045/) technique.

Methods
-------
* **Nested Packing**: the malware is packed by one packer, the result is packed, etc.
* **Standard Compression**: Uses a standard algorithm, such as UPX or LZMA, to compress an executable file.
* **Standard Compression of Code**: Uses a standard algorithm to compress the opcode mnemonics.
* **Standard Compression of Data**: Uses a standard algorithm to compress strings and variables (executable file data).
* **Custom Compression**: Uses a custom algorithm to compress an executable file.
* **Custom Compression of Code**: Uses a custom algorithm to compress opcode mnemonics.
* **Custom Compression of Data**: Uses a custom algorithm to compress strings and variables (executable file data).
