Install Additional Program
==========================
Installs another, different program on the system. The additional program can be any secondary module; examples include backdoors, malicious drivers, kernel modules, and OS X Apps. 

Malware that installs another component is called a "dropper." If the code is contained in the malware, it's a "single stage" dropper; "two stage" droppers download the code from a remote location (the associated download behavior is covered by the [Remote File Copy](../command-and-control/remote-file-copy.md) behavior).
