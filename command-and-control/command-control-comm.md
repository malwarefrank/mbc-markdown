C2 Communication
================
All command and control malware use client/server communication. The methods listed below can be used to capture explicit communication details. Remote file copy behavior is captured separately, as is done in ATT&CK - see [Remote File Copy](../command-and-control/remote-file-copy.md).

Command and Control Communication relates to *autonomous* client/server communications, not explicit, on-demand commands that malware provides to an adversary (such commands should be captured with [Remote Commands](../execution/remote-commands.md) under the Execution objective).
