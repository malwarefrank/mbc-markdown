Sandbox Detection
=================
Detects whether the malware instance is being executed inside an instrumented sandbox environment (e.g., Cuckoo Sandbox). If so, conditional execution selects a benign execution path.

The Sandbox Detection behavior relates to anti-analysis, whereas a related ATT&CK technique relates to [Defense Evasion](../defense-evasion): for details, see the ATT&CK: [**Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/).

Methods
-------
* **Check Clipboard Data**: Checks clipboard data which can be used to detect whether execution is inside a sandbox.
* **Check Files**: Sandboxes create files on the file system. Malware can check the different folders to find sandbox artifacts.
* **Human User Check**: Detects whether there is any "user" activity on the machine, such as the movement of the mouse cursor, non-default wallpaper, or recently opened Office files. If there is no human activity, the machine is suspected to be a virtualized machine and/or sandbox. Other items used to detect a user: mouse clicks (single/double), DialogBox, scrolling, color of background pixel [[3]](#3).
* **Injected DLL Testing**: Testing for the name of a particular DLL that is known to be injected by a sandbox for API hooking is a common way of detecting sandbox environments. This can be achieved through the kernel32!GetModuleHandle API call and other means.
* **Product Key/ID Testing**: Checking for a particular product key/ID associated with a sandbox environment (commonly associated with the Windows host OS used in the environment) can be used to detect whether a malware instance is being executed in a particular sandbox. This can be achieved through several means, including testing for the Key/ID in the Windows registry. 
* **Screen Resolution Testing**: Sandboxes aren't used in the same manner as a typical user environment, so most of the time the screen resolution stays at the minimum 800x600 or lower. No one is actually working on a such small screen. Malware could potentially detect the screen resolution to determine if it's a user machine or a sandbox.
* **Self Check**: Malware may check its own characteristics to determine whether it's running in a sandbox. For example, a malicious Office document might check its file name or VB project name.
* **Timing/Date Check**: Calling GetSystemTime or equiv and only executing code if the current date/hour/minute/second passes some check. Often this is for running only after or only until a specific date. This behavior can be mitigated in non-automated analysis environments.
* **Timing/Uptime Check**: Comparing single GetTickCount with some value to see if system has been started at least *X* amount ago. This behavior can be mitigated in non-automated analysis environments.
